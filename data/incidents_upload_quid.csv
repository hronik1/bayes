Tennant and K. Jarrell.  I clicked enroute by mobile so that I could handle the call and let the third shift officers go home.The CAD notes (paraphrased) stated:Meet with complainant in ref. to vandalism to his vehicle...just occurred...ex girl-friend keyed his vehicle...she is still at the scene.  Female is intoxicated.  She is in a cab, but complainant is not letting the cab leave.I arrived on scene first and the complainant, Callan Jennings, was standing in the parking lot.  The suspect, Angela Harper, was seated in the front passenger seat of a Bluebird van.  Mr. Jennings stated he and Ms. Harper dated for about a year and broke up in January of 2013.  Ms. Harper beat on his apartment door the first time around 0520 hours.  He opened the door and told her to leave.  Ms. Harper was intoxicated.  She came back the second time around 0530 hours and started beating on his door again.  He opened the door and this time told her he was calling the Police.  Mr. Jennings watched Ms. Harper from his balcony window which faces the parking lot where the cab and his vehicle were parked.  He said she fumbled through her pocketbook and obtained what he thought were keys.  He watched her walk over to the right passenger side of his vehicle and ""key"" his vehicle.  He then came outside and told the cab driver not to leave since he had called the Police.I spoke to Angela Harper while she was seated in the cab.  She was intoxicated. She admitted she knocked on his door twice.  She and Mr. Jennings dated for a year and broke up in November of 2012.  She denied damaging Mr. Jennings` vehicle.  Much later during our conversation, she stated Mr. Jennings pushed her on the deck (stairway landing) and she fell.  She did not mention having any injuries.  I asked her why did she come over to Mr. Jennings`s apartment intoxicated, and she said because she loves him.  I explained to her that she just needed to tell the truth about the damage so that I could make a decision about arresting her or giving her a citation.  (I said this to see if she would tell the truth.) She got loud and started cursing Mr. Jennings at one point.  I spoke with the Bluebird cab driver, Abuljahfeel Altholaya.  He stated he drove her to the apartment building and she exited and then came back crying.  They had not left the complex when she told him to go back to the same building.  I asked him if he witnessed Ms. Harper damage the vehicle, and he said no because he was tired and lying back in the driver`s seat.I then asked Mr. Jennings if he pushed Ms. Harper.  Mr. Jennings denied touching her in any way. I advised him if she comes back, not to open the door, but just to call the Police.  I also advised him about obtaining a 50B order.  Officer B. Tennant gave Mr. Jennings the DV victim letter and information sheet.  I also had Mr. Jennings advise Ms. Harper not to come back to his apartment. Mr. Jennings took photographs of the damage to his vehicle and will have them for court.Officer Jarrell checked to see if Ms. Harper was wanted and she was not.  Officer Jarrell spoke to Ms. Harper who was still seated in the cab.  She told him that she wanted to report an assault and then stated that was why she ""keyed"" Mr. Jennings` vehicle.  He asked her if she had any injuries and she said no.  Ms. Harper started yelling that she needed to go to the bathroom.  I gave Ms. Harper a citation for Injury to Personal Property since I had not witnessed the vandalism and this was not a Domestic Violence offense in which I could make a warrantless arrest.  I then directed the cab driver to leave with Ms. Harper.I recommend this case be cleared by arrest.  I completed an arrest report."

201235601,10/2/12,ASSAULT - SIMPLE PHYSICAL,1422 S MAIN ST,CLRD,TU,2012,October,DOMESTIC DISTUR,"On October 2, 2012 at approximately 0352 hours, I was dispatched to a report of a woman screaming in the area of 1422 South Main Street.  While enroute, Police communications updated that the suspect and the possible female were driving a car with a flat tire on Park Street.  Officer Dan Sellars and I had dealt with this couple earlier and remembered that they lived on Blair Street.Officers went to Blair Street where the female was standing in the middle of the road.  She had an obvious injury above her right eye, scratches on the left side of her neck and a swollen lip (on the left side).  We asked where her boyfriend was and she stated that he was at the house, 610 Blair Street.  She told me that they have been together for about a year.  She also went on to tell me that he did not hit her, she fell down on her front porch and that the scratches on her neck were from ""rough sex"".When we dealt with this couple earlier (reference a disturbance call from Walmart - 2628 South Main Street), Lucas had apparently got into an argument with an employee at the store, who in turn called the Police.  They left before we got there, with Dickens driving, northbound on North Main Street with a front left flat tire.  Officer Sellars, who stopped the car on the lot of the Salvation Army, advised me that he actually was in close proximity to Dickens to determine if she had been drinking or not and is positive that there were no injuries to her face at all.  The injuries occurred when the call came in reporting a woman screaming.Lts. Tony English, Jay Yandle and I went down the street to 610 Blair Street to attempt to make contact with Lucas.  My intention was to arrest him for domestic assault.  He came to a window and told us to get off his property.  We explained to him that he needed to come to the door and talk to us.  After about 5 minutes, he came to the door and unlocked it.  Lt. English and I arrested him at the front door and walked him to my car.  Lucas was trying to pull away, especially during search and, at first, refused to get in the back of my car.  He also smelled very heavily of alcohol.  Lucas would contend that he did not hurt Dickens, that she had hurt herself on the steps.  Of course, Dickens had told Lucas this information through the door at the house just before the arrest.  Lucas` mom had come to Blair Street and was also told by Dickens that she fell on the front steps.I transported Lucas to the Police Department for processing, barely gathering his Pistol photo.  He was quite uncooperative with processing and we decided not to attempt to fingerprint him in his intoxicated and agitated state.  I transported him to the Magistrate`s Office (along with the fill-in of Lt. Yandle) on the charges of assault on a female (domestic related).  I was given probable cause by Magistrate Newman and placed Lucas in jail under a domestic hold.While swearing in and testifying for the case, Dickens was in the lobby trying to ask questions about the case.  I instructed her that she was given all the information that she needed at the scene and that she needed to go home.  She would continue to stand at the window and ask the same questions over and over.  I explained to her that she was disrupting the proceedings and that if she didn`t leave, I was going to charge her with trespassing.  She continued and once I went towards the door, she walked out.  But, she was back a minute later.  I again asked her a couple of times to please leave so that I could finish what I was doing.  She refused, continuing to stand there.  I decided to arrest her for trespassing.  I brought her into the holding area and she was ultimately given a written promise to appear.  She walked back to her house without further problems.  It should be noted that while both were in the holding cells, Lucas would yell at Dickens that it was her fault the ""cops were called"" and when she would attempt to speak, he would tell her to shut up.Lucas was placed in jailed under a domestic hold.  He would continue to call Officers ""cracker"" and ""punk ass"" and that we had no reason to arrest him.  His eyes were extremely bloodshot red and he smelled heavily of alcohol.  He made threats to Officers (telling Lt. Yandle he had a bullet for him and that he was going to get me).  I added this information into his Pistol file.Dickens was given the domestic violence paperwork on the scene on Blair Street."

When I arrived on scene, several officers were already speaking with both parties involved.While walking up to the residence, I observed a white female sitting on the front porch to 1603 Woodside Ave.   It was obvious the female was impaired by alcohol because she was being very loud and belligerent toward Officer Crouse.  Recruit Plount and I then walked inside the residence and observed a white male sitting on the couch that was just inside the front door.   The male had a large knot just above his left eye from a recent assault.   Officer Leach was talking with the male who identified himself as Mr. Gordon Arnold II.Officer Dodson was in the rear of the residence talking with two other individuals that were both lying in the bed.    I then walked back out to the living room and started to talk with Mr. Arnold.  Mr. Arnold was obviously impaired as well from alcohol and admitted to being drunk.    Mr. Arnold said he and his wife got into an argument and she assaulted him.   I asked how he got the large knot above his eye and he said, ""The bitch hit me with a lamp"".  I then asked where the assault took place and he said in their bedroom.    Mr. Arnold then pulled up the sleeve to his shirt and revealed a bite mark to his right tricep.   Mr. Arnold said sometime during the struggle, Cyanne bit him on his arm.  While talking with Mr. Arnold he kept saying that his good friend was Terry Green with our department.I then went out to the front porch where Officer Crouse and Mrs. Arnold (Cyanne) were talking.  I started to ask Cyanne what took place and all she would do is shout obscenities and would not answer any of my questions.  I asked Mrs. Arnold if she was assaulted and all she would do is say look at my knee.   Her right knee had some minor scraps to them.  The entire time talking with Cyanne she was uncooperative and would not answer any questions.Based on the severity of the injuries to Mr. Arnold and Cyanne not cooperating with any questions I was asking, I then placed Cyanne in handcuffs and informed her that she was under arrest.   Once handcuffed, I had Cyanne sit back in the chair on the front porch, so I could go back inside and speak with Mr. Arnold.  Officer Crouse remained outside with Cyanne.I asked Mr. Arnold which was his bedroom and he said it was the last one on the right as you go toward the end of the hall.   I walked to the back bedroom where the struggle took place.   Once inside the bedroom, it was obvious a struggle took place.   There was a lamp lying on the floor in front of the bed.   A broken light bulb was shattered all over the floor.  I noticed a table that was tipped on its side in the bedroom as well.Officer Leach assisted with digital photos of Mr. Arnold`s injuries while on scene.While sitting on the front porch in handcuffs, Cyanne started to get verbally abusive.   Officer Crouse then asked for the keys to my patrol car and escorted her to my patrol car and secured her in the rear seat of my patrol car.  While sitting in the backseat of the patrol car, Cyanne started to hyperventilate.  Officer Crouse asked if she was on any medications and she said she has COPD and asthma.   Officer Crouse then rolled down the back window to allow some cold air in.   Cyanne started to control her breathing after a few minutes.   Officer Crouse called for EMS to the scene reference her breathing problems.  HPFD arrived shortly after, by this time, Cyanne had her breathing under control and started to curse at the HPFD.   EMS was cancelled.Mrs. Arnold (Cyanne) was then transported to the High Point Police Department to be processed.   Once inside the Police Department, Cyanne started to calm down and wanted to give her side of the story.   While sitting on the bench in the processing room, Cyanne pulled up the sleeves to her shirt and showed the marks on her biceps from where Mr. Arnold grabbed her.  There was bruising that had already set in.Cyanne went on to say they were all in the back yard drinking having a good time when she had enough to drink and went inside the house.  She said she went to her bedroom and started to clean up when Gordon walked into the bedroom and started to yell at her.   When she went to lie down in the bed, she said Gordon jumped on her and held her down.  She said she kicked him in the ""balls"" to get him off.  Cyanne said once he got off of her, she tried to run away.   That is when he grabbed her and threw her to the floor.   He once again got on top of her and was holding her down.  This is when she said she grabbed the lamp that was on the night stand next to the  bed and struck him in the head several times to get him off of her again.   Once she struck him in the head, he fell off of her and she ran out of the bedroom.  This is when her roommate called 911.I spoke with the roommate Cheryl Delk who said she went to bed and was inside the bedroom when she heard the fight take place.
